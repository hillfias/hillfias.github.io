# Welcome to the HomeOffice Project

Here we'll be talking about how to best equipe a home office, from the chair, to the desk.

I'm not sure if everything related to my PC, or future PC plan, and related hardware, and keyboard explorations belong here. They probably deserve their own project, outside of either the HomeOffice or HomeLab projects.

In any case, I will link you back to wherever that will be, whenever it's not strictly about furniture, or printers, scaners, note-taking utilities etc.
