# Support Me
You like what you're seeing? Consider supporting me.
Whether you found one of my youtube videos impactful, liked a live, appreciated one of my technical posts or product reviews, my talent at Rocket League or simply want to say _thank you_ for everything I'm putting online for your entertainment / knowledge; you can directly support me!

## Let's Get Something Straight
I don't *need* your money (to live). I would _like_ your money (to grow this website and everything I offer you). Please.

However, if you're short on money; you're probably the empathetic, kind soul that would easily give to say thank you and support me.  
Please don't.

There are other ways you can support me. I'm incredibly grateful for any type of feedback, positive or negative, as long as it's constructive and I can build upon it.  
Just a few nice words, a comment here, a like there; makes a world of difference.  
There are no ads on this website, because I hate ads; but you can support me by watching ads on the platforms I stream/post videos to.

Thank you so much for clicking on this link, for being here, and for having considered supporting me; but, again, please don't :slight_smile:

## Now that that's said...

You really want to support me. Thank you.  
If you have the money to spare, this will greatly help me in growing my various activities, for your greatest pleasure.  
There are multiple ways you can help me out, on top of what I've previously said atop:
