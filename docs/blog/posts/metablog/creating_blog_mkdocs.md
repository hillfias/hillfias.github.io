# The MetaBlog - Birth
First article of the metablog, this is exciting. But what the heck is a metablog?
<!-- more -->

## What's Meta? Are we talking about Facebook?
As my high-school philosophy teacher taught me, you must always start by defining your terms.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :fontawesome-brands-html5: __HTML__ for content and structure
- :fontawesome-brands-js: __JavaScript__ for interactivity
- :fontawesome-brands-css3: __CSS__ for text running out of boxes
- :fontawesome-brands-internet-explorer: __Internet Explorer__ ... huh?
