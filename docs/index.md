# Welcome to the blog, friend

Really glad to have you here. Right now, it really is under construction, there isn't much to see or read.
Sure, you'll be able to grasp a glimpse of what the future might hold, but that's all there is to it.

There are two articles I'd like to focus on, three actually (four now!! the list is growing! Five, six!!):

-   :birthday: &nbsp;
    __[The Metasite - Birth](blog/posts/metasite/metasite_birth.md)__

    This first article will describe the adventure I'm currently going through, trying to create my first website via the, truly, awesome [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).  
    Not my first website though, but first time with this framework, which should make this one the first "professional" looking one.

    Another article is on the way: [The Metasite - First Steps](blog/posts/metasite/metasite_first_steps.md). It's not finished however, so I'd advise patience.

    !!! danger "This has not been published yet!"
    Yep, that's the one that started all of this. This is the reason I'm starting this blog. It was too painful and not rewarding enough to write this on Reddit. At some point, I lost an evening trying to edit my post to add more to the article I was writing and researching, which ended up not working. I gave up, and here we are :smile:

    __This Home Page!__

    And finally, I'd like to revamp this home page to properly welcome you, give myself another huge list of tasks to make sure my night job will slow me down on my road to becoming a professional Rocket League player.
    I started writing the [Support Me](/support_william_fuchs/) page, but it's far from over. I need to make the text more concise, and only two payment options are working right now (Paypal and Patreon).

    :negative_squared_cross_mark: What you're seeing here is purely temporary, this needs to be redone entirely.

## Let's detail the TODOs and measure progress
- [X] Write _Metasite - Birth_ article
- [ ] Write _Metasite - First Steps_ article
- [ ] Finish _NAS Migration_ article
- [ ] Finish _Support Me_ page
- [ ] Write _About Me_ page
- [ ] Rework this Home page
- [ ] And then, there's **a lot** to do before I'll find this site satisfactory for publishing. Right now, in its current form. That's not it. But it's a nice start.
