# Welcome to the blog, friend

Really glad to have you here. Right now, it really is under construction, there isn't much to see or read.

    __[The MetaBlog - Birth](blog/create-blog-mkdocs-material)__

    Yep, that's the one that started all of this. This is the reason I'm starting this blog. It was too painful and not rewarding enough to write this on Reddit. At some point, I lost an evening trying to edit my post to add more to the article I was writing and researching, which ended up not working. I gave up, and here we are :smile:

    And finally, I'd like to revamp this home page to properly welcome you, give myself another huge list of tasks to make sure my night job will slow me down on my road to becoming a professional Rocket League player.
